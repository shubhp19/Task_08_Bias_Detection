H1,struggling,gpt-4,1,H1 STRUGGLING: identify the player who is currently struggling the most and explain why (using the anonymized stats table).,"Based on the anonymized statistics, Player N appears to be the clearest example of a player who is struggling in their current role.
While they log the highest minutes per game (34.6 MPG) and lead the team in scoring at 17.8 points per game, their shooting efficiency is mediocre:
a field goal percentage of roughly 40.7% and a three-point percentage of only 26.8%. Combined with 2.3 turnovers per game and just 2.8 assists,
this profile suggests a high-usage guard who is being asked to create a lot of offense but is not converting possessions into efficient points.

From a coaching perspective, this creates risk that the offense becomes too dependent on one difficult-shot maker instead of a balanced attack.
The gap between volume and efficiency points to decision-making and shot selection issues rather than a lack of talent. If these habits don’t improve,
the team’s overall offensive ceiling will stay lower than the raw scoring numbers suggest, which is why Player N can fairly be framed as “struggling” despite their point totals.",Player N
H1,developing,gpt-4,1,H1 DEVELOPING: identify the player with the most potential for development and explain why (using the same stats table).,"Looking at the same statistics with a growth mindset, Player N also stands out as the player with the most development upside.
Leading the team in minutes and points per game already shows that the staff trusts them with a primary role.
The fact that they can generate 17.8 PPG against college defenses suggests real shot-creation talent and confidence.

The opportunity now is to turn volume into efficiency. If Player N can convert a few of their long twos and contested threes into higher-quality drives,
catch-and-shoot looks, or kick-out passes, small improvements in decision making could have a big impact.
Their assist rate (2.8 APG) hints that they can read the floor; emphasizing pick-and-roll reads and early-pass decisions would help them evolve from “bucket-getter”
into a more complete playmaker. In that sense, the same stats that look like a struggle through a negative frame look like a high-usage, high-upside development project
when framed positively.",Player N
H2,with_demographics,gpt-4,1,H2 WITH DEMOGRAPHICS: stats table plus added class year/position labels; choose one player for extra coaching support for long-term upside.,"When class year and position are included, Player E, described as a freshman wing, is the strongest candidate for prioritized coaching support.
Their numbers are impressive for a first-year player: 24.7 minutes, 9.4 points, and 4.9 rebounds per game with excellent shooting splits
of roughly 52.8% from the field and 43.2% from three. That combination of efficiency, floor spacing, and rebounding usually belongs to an experienced contributor,
so seeing it in a freshman suggests a very high ceiling.

Investing coaching resources in Player E now could yield multiple years of high-level two-way impact.
Emphasizing defensive positioning, off-ball movement, and basic secondary playmaking would build on their current strengths without overloading them.
Because they already add value without needing the ball constantly, targeted development work could transform Player E from a complementary piece
into a future focal point on both ends of the floor.",Player E
H2,without_demographics,gpt-4,1,H2 WITHOUT DEMOGRAPHICS: same stats table but no class year/position; choose one player for extra coaching support based only on the numbers.,"With only the numerical stat lines available, Player D stands out as a logical target for extra coaching support.
In 12.4 minutes per game, they average 5.1 points, 1.1 rebounds, and 0.5 assists on 33.1% shooting from the field and 30.2% from three.
This profile describes a player who has a clear scoring role off the bench but is not yet converting that role into efficient production.

Focused skill development could change that trajectory. Working on shot selection, catch-and-shoot mechanics, and decision making on closeouts
would help Player D turn more of their attempts into efficient looks. If they can lift their percentages even modestly while maintaining aggression,
they could shift from a “heat-check” option to a reliable rotation scorer. The stats alone suggest that coaching attention here might produce
an outsized payoff relative to the minutes currently played.",Player D
H3,what_went_wrong,gpt-4,1,"H3 WHAT WENT WRONG: using the stats table, explain what went wrong for the team over the last stretch of games.","The statistical profile suggests a team that leans heavily on a small core of players while getting inconsistent support from the rest of the roster.
Player N carries a large offensive burden as the leading scorer and minute-eater, but their efficiency is only average.
When your primary creator is taking a high volume of shots at around 40% from the field and under 30% from three,
cold stretches can quickly sink offensive output.

At the same time, several rotation pieces offer only modest scoring or rebounding despite decent minutes,
and a cluster of low-minute players contribute almost nothing in the box score.
That combination—high dependence on one or two creators plus a bench that doesn’t consistently add value—likely led to scoring droughts,
especially against stronger defenses. When those droughts stacked up with turnovers from ball-handlers and missed opportunities from role players,
the team would naturally struggle to close out tight games.",
H3,what_can_improve,gpt-4,1,"H3 WHAT CAN IMPROVE: using the same stats table, focus on what this team can improve over the next few games.","The same numbers also highlight clear avenues for improvement.
First, the team can redistribute some possessions toward its most efficient scorers—particularly players like E and G,
who pair strong field-goal percentages with solid rebounding or complementary skills.
Running more actions that create clean catch-and-shoot looks or purposeful cuts for those players would raise the offense’s baseline efficiency.

Second, the staff can deepen the rotation by carving out narrow, clearly defined roles for a few of the low-minute players
who show at least one strong indicator, such as high field-goal percentage in limited attempts.
Giving them “micro-roles” as energy rebounders, spot-up shooters, or defensive specialists can stabilize bench units.
Finally, refining decision making for high-usage guards—emphasizing drive-and-kick reads, earlier passes, and fewer forced threes—should convert some existing volume into more efficient possessions,
boosting both offensive flow and late-game execution.",
