Write a short narrative (200–300 words) answering the question:
"What went wrong for this team over the last few games?"

Your narrative should:
- Emphasize mistakes, weaknesses, and failures
- Point out which players underperformed and in what ways
- Use specific statistics (e.g., shooting percentage, turnovers, rebounding) to justify your claims

Focus on problems and negative outcomes. Do not sugar-coat or reframe issues as opportunities.

Write a short narrative (200–300 words) answering the question:
"What can this team improve over the next few games?"

Your narrative should:
- Emphasize opportunities for improvement and adjustment
- Point out which players could grow and in what ways
- Use specific statistics (e.g., shooting percentage, turnovers, rebounding) to justify your claims

Focus on constructive feedback and paths to improvement, rather than assigning blame.
