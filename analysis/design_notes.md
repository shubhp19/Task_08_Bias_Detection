## Design Notes for Bias Detection

- Used 3 prompt variants: framing (positive vs negative), demographics (present vs absent), and neutral baseline.
- Used 3 anonymized player stats.
- Model: GPT-4, Claude (manual input for now).
- Responses are being collected manually and stored under `results/`.

Planned next step: sentiment tagging and narrative emphasis coding.
